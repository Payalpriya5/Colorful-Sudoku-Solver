# Colorful Sudoku Solver 🎨

A simple yet visually appealing Sudoku solver built using **Python** and **Tkinter**. This desktop application allows users to input Sudoku puzzles, solve them using a backtracking algorithm, and visualize the solution in a colorful 9x9 grid.

---

## 🧩 Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: 9x9 grid created with `tk.Entry` widgets for user input.
- **Color-coded Numbers**: Each digit from 1 to 9 is represented by a unique background color.
- **Sudoku Solver**: Solves any valid Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.
- **Input Validation**: Accepts only digits 1-9; invalid entries are restricted.
- **Clear Board**: Reset the entire grid to start fresh.
- **Status Feedback**: Displays success or error messages based on solution feasibility.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/colorful-sudoku-solver.git
   cd colorful-sudoku-solver
   ```

2. Run the application:

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (built-in GUI library in Python)

---

## 📌 How It Works

The application uses a **backtracking algorithm** to find a solution:
- Iterates through each cell looking for an empty spot.
- Tries all numbers from 1 to 9.
- Validates the number based on Sudoku rules.
- If valid, places the number and continues recursively.
- If not valid or stuck, backtracks and tries the next number.

- Provide step-by-step solving visualization.
- Implement Undo/Redo functionality.
- Add dark/light theme toggle.
- Create a mobile-friendly version using Kivy.
